Welcome!

How to use application:

Using MySQL to create a database and table for items to "purchase",
this application runs via node to display the store of products, quantities, prices,
etc. You will be prompted asking what you would like to purchase, you will use the "item number".
You will then be prompted asking how many of that product you would like. If the stock is available,
the purchase will be successful and the quantities will deduct from the available quantity from the store. The MySQL
data base is updated and If the purchase is not successful, you will prompted the stock is not sufficient and to try again.

You will use: Node to run the JavaScript file: "bamazonCustomer.js" and the application will begin.
